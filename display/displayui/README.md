# Instructions

See [howto](../../HOWTO.md) notes for installation and running instructions.

If the contracts have already been deployed, to recover the artifacts run the following:
```
source .env
source push_artifacts.sh "Deploy.s.sol/<chainid>"

```
where <chainid> is the Chain ID of the blockchain where the contracts are deployed.
